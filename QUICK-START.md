# Quick Start - Public Website Deployment

## âœ… Project is Ready!

Your public marketing website has been created and tested successfully.

## Current Status

- âœ… Project created at `/Users/jonoairey/privly-public`
- âœ… All marketing pages copied and working
- âœ… Build tested and passing
- âœ… UI components configured
- âœ… Contact form ready (forwards to main app)
- âœ… Redirects configured in main app (disabled until you deploy)

## Deploy in 5 Minutes

### 1. Create GitHub Repository

```bash
cd /Users/jonoairey/privly-public
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - Privly public website"
```

Create repo on GitHub:
- Name: `privly-public`
- Visibility: Public or Private

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/privly-public.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 2. Deploy to Vercel

1. Go to [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new)
2. Import your `privly-public` repository
3. Click "Deploy"

That's it! Vercel will:
- Auto-detect Next.js
- Install dependencies
- Build the project
- Deploy it

### 3. Configure Domain (Optional but Recommended)

After deployment:

1. Go to Project Settings â†’ Domains
2. Add your domain: `www.useprivly.com` or `useprivly.com`
3. Follow Vercel's DNS instructions

### 4. Add Environment Variables

In Vercel project settings â†’ Environment Variables:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://www.useprivly.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://www.useprivly.com
```

Redeploy after adding env vars.

### 5. Enable Redirects in Main App (When Ready)

Once public site is working, go to your main app (`privly-me`) in Vercel:

1. Add environment variable:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_MARKETING_SITE_URL=https://www.useprivly.com
   ```

2. Redeploy main app

3. Now traffic flows correctly:
   - `/` â†’ Public site
   - `/scam-watch` â†’ Public site
   - `/dashboard` â†’ Main app
   - `/auth/*` â†’ Main app
   - `/api/*` â†’ Main app

## What Pages Are Included?

**âœ… Public Pages:**
- Homepage (`/`)
- Product pages (`/scam-watch`, `/personal`, `/professional`)
- Pricing (`/pricing`)
- About (`/about`)
- Blog (`/blog`)
- Legal (`/privacy`, `/terms`)
- Use cases (`/use-cases/*`)
- Business (`/for-business`, `/family`)

**ðŸ”’ Main App Pages (stay in privly-me):**
- Dashboard (`/dashboard/*`)
- Authentication (`/auth/*`)
- APIs (`/api/*`)
- Payments (`/payment/*`)

## Test Locally First (Optional)

```bash
cd /Users/jonoairey/privly-public
npm run dev
```

Visit: `http://localhost:3000`

Check:
- âœ… Homepage loads
- âœ… Product pages work
- âœ… Pricing page works
- âœ… All buttons link to signup/signin

## Rollback

If anything goes wrong, simply:
1. Remove `NEXT_PUBLIC_MARKETING_SITE_URL` from main app
2. Redeploy main app
3. Everything goes back to how it was
